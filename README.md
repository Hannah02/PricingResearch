## Kickstarters

A lot of these projects are American so I have had to convert the purchase prices for individial books from USD to GBP so they are approximate.
I have decided to focus on researching Kickstarter projects that are publications featuring women. 
Some of these are magazines while others are physical books so I need to keep in mind what type of book I want to publish.
All of the featured projects have reached their goal, with most exceeding it substantially.

#### Research Conclusion

Between £15 and £20 sounds about right for this project, but I want to keep the costs low while still maintaining the product quality.

If I do a full book, a high quality paperback should be the way forward as the cost to produce a hard cover is so much higher and will also drive up shipping costs, which will put off potential backers. I don't want someone to purchase the book for £15 and then have to pay £20+ shipping because of the weight and size of the book. 

I need to do some research as I need to take shipping into account.

All of the above projects got funded and most surpassed their goal.
